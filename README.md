# Music-Features

A simple web app that shows Spotify users their top listened artists and tracks.

This app uses :

- The Spotify API to fetch the user related data.
- Python/Pandas/Numpy to aggregate and process the data.
- Flask/Dash/Plotly to manage a simple front end. 

Acknowledgements:

- [Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy) (spotify API wrapper)
- [Spotify-Flask](https://github.com/mari-linhares/spotify-flask) (for the Auth method)

Note: I do NOT collect any user data. 

TODO: I'm planning to extend the web app functionality in the future to better showcase the features of your favourite songs, with the aim of better understanding musical tastes.
